                <b><h2 class="title">Dream after End</h2></b>
            <p class="P1">Many of us know that me and my batchmates journey here on our present school don bosco tarlac nearly comes to a close. After the coming graduation the end of our journey as a senior high school student comes to an end. I was always told that every new beginning comes from some other beginningâ€™s end and that new beginning is the start of our college life. Ever since grade 10 I already know my goal in life and that is to become a successful Software engineer, Investor and entrepreneur.</p>
        <p class="P2">Those dreams of mine might sound ambitious but I promice I can make all of this connected in one single career. First of all, I must learn to invest more than to save which could help me build net worth even before I go to college. Second, I must know the 4 basic parts of a financial statement and those are Assets, liabilities, income and expenses which help me realize that in order to be rich I must build assets that produce a higher amount of income than those expenses I get from my liabilities.</p>
   <p class="P3">Finally in order to become a software engineer I must start young on learning the fundamentals of coding and programming such as building a website with the use of html, css and java script this is also why I choose to study computer science course on college which could help me land a front-end developer or even a full stack developer job after college while studying in college I would also be self-thought about business. This are one of many dreams of mine that mark the beginning of the end chapter of my life as a senior high school student I hope to achieve all of this in the upcoming years. Now again those are my dreams that mark a new chapter of my life.</p>
